If you are interested in writing your own shell, then this might be interesting. Otherwise don't use this :)

## Basics
The idea is to provide all the basic functionality that a standard shell provides, including common builtins,
mostly to learn more about Unix and C++.

## Roadmap
Pretty much everything is still waiting to be done, mainly:

* More builtins (alias, declare, let, local, logout... )
* Piping
* File redirection
* Variable expansion
* Colors :)
